Temperature and/or Pressure Calculations Procedure for Multi-component Liquid and Gaseous Phases  

ULTIMATE PURPOSE
Consider a system which has a set of component combination residing in a stated pressure or temperature value. The code provides to evaluate an exact value for Dew Pressure, Dew Temperature, Bubble Pressure or Bubble Temperature. Briefly, These terms stand for: 
Dew Temperature; for a given pressure and gaseous molar composition for a specified system, the calculation results in the exact temperature value which would provide the initial discriminant for liquid formation. 
Dew Pressure; for a given temperature and gaseous molar composition for a specified system, the calculation results in the exact pressure value which would provide the initial discriminant for liquid formation. 
Bubble Temperature; for a given pressure and liquid molar composition for a specified system, the calculation results in the exact temperature value which would provide the initial discriminant for gas formation. 
Bubble Pressure; for a given temperature and liquid molar composition for a specified system, the calculation results in the exact pressure value which would provide the initial discriminant for gas formation.
